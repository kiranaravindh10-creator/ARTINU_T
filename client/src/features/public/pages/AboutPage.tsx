    bottles whose labels dissolve into noise when you look at them. It was
    standing in for the one thing this whole page is arguing is real — that an
    ARTINU photograph ends up on an actual wall, in an actual room, where actual
    people sit.

    Nib & Nosh in Rajajinagar is that room, and photographs of it were already
    in this repository, shot for the homepage collaboration section:
    `/image/partners/nib-and-nosh-interior-1-*.webp`. The frames on that wall are
    ARTINU frames holding ARTINU photographers' work. Nothing needed generating;
    the honest picture was already here.

    The synthetic frame that used to be composited over this slot has gone with
    it — see the note where stage 03 renders.

                  This was `IMAGES.installing`, and it was wrong twice over. The
                  photograph is a staged American living room — a fireplace, a
                  bay window, cushions squared off by an estate agent — which is
                  nobody's café and nothing to do with ARTINU. And its alt text
                  claimed "a member of the ARTINU team hanging a framed
                  photograph", describing a person who is not in the picture;
                  the note at the top of lib/images.ts warns that the names in
                  that map are not to be trusted, and this was one of them.

                  The copy beside it says walls should start doing something and
                  that people notice the room they are sitting in. Nib & Nosh in
                  Rajajinagar is a room where that is literally true, and the
                  photograph was already in the repository. `interior-2` rather
                  than `interior-1` because the hero at the top of this same page
                  already uses `interior-1`.

                  The master is 1024×1280 — exactly the 4:5 this slot reserves —
                  so nothing is cropped, and generated-images.ts already carries
                  its blur placeholder and srcSet, which `Photo` resolves from
                  the filename on its own.

                the picture said "you need this equipment". A photographer
                reading it on the phone they actually shoot with was being shown
                the gear they do not own.

                `photographersHero` is an ARTINU asset already in the repository
                (used on the Artists page): somebody photographing an evening
                street in India, an auto-rickshaw in the frame, holding up a
                phone. Same message the copy makes — the eye is the equipment.

                Reused rather than sourced anew, deliberately. The alternative
                was generating one, and an invented photograph of "authentic

                ARTINU is not another place to upload photographs. We take work by local

                city, printed and framed and credited. Someone finds it while they wait for a
                coffee. They read your name off the wall. That is a slower kind of recognition
                than a like, and it stays with people far longer.

                  ARTINU is run by a small team in Bengaluru. The same people who survey your walls
                  choose the work, print it, and turn up with the drill on installation day. You
                  will deal with us directly, not with an account manager.
                </p>
                <p className="prose-quiet mt-4">
                  We started this because of the photographers we kept meeting. Genuinely good
                  work, and almost nowhere for it to go beyond a grid of thumbnails. A few of them
                  had never once seen a photograph of theirs printed at size.
                </p>
                <p className="prose-quiet mt-4">
                  So the plan is bigger than filling walls. We want a place where local
                  photographers get found, credited and paid properly, and where someone sitting in
                  a café can look up, like what they see, and go and find out who made it. That
                  takes more spaces and more time than we have behind us so far. As the walls come
                  on board, more photographers get shown, and we grow with the people whose work
                  got us here.

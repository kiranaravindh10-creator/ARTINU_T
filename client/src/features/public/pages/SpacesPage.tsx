  WHAT ARTINU DOES FOR EACH KIND OF ROOM.

  This is the founder's material in full - all eight points per room, nine for
  hotels, plus the room-by-room lists he supplied for offices, restaurants,
  homes and hotels. An earlier version carried four of the eight; he sent the
  whole thing twice, so the whole thing is here.

  Two decisions about how it is presented, both of which matter given how often
  he has objected to pages that "look AI":

  It is NOT forty icon cards. Eight lucide glyphs over eight Title Case nouns,
  five times over, would be the largest instance on the site of exactly the
  shape he keeps rejecting. It is a definition list: a bold line and a sentence,
  two columns, no glyphs.

  It shows one room at a time, driven by the selector above. A cafe owner does
  not need to read the case for hotels, and forty-one points on screen at once
  is a brochure nobody finishes.

  Propositions are his words, with the em dashes turned into single hyphens per
  his note about double dashes.

    answer:
      'Say so - nothing is final until you approve it. During curation you can swap any frame for another from the gallery, or send us back to look again with what you did not like written down. After installation, if a photograph is not working in the room, we change it at your next rotation at no cost. If it is genuinely wrong for the wall - wrong scale, wrong tone, wrong light - tell us within fourteen days and we will change it sooner than that.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Who owns the art?',
    answer: `The photographer owns the copyright, always; that never transfers to us or to you. The photographs inside the frames are licensed to you for display while they hang, which is why they come back to us at each swap. Nobody may reproduce, resell or merchandise the image beyond that display licence - not you, not us. We ensure artists are fairly compensated for every photograph displayed.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens on rotation day?',
    answer:
      'We confirm a two-hour window with you first, usually before service or before the office fills. Two people arrive with the next set already printed and mounted, lift each photograph out of its frame, set the new one in and take the old prints away for archiving. Frames, hangers and wall fixings stay exactly where they are - no new holes, no repainting, no dust sheet over your furniture for a day. Most spaces are finished in ninety minutes and nothing has to close.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you work outside Bengaluru?',
    answer:
      'No. Bengaluru is the only city we work in. Our crew, our print lab and our framers are all here, which is why the survey, the install and every rotation after it are done in-house by the same people rather than handed to a contractor we have never met. If your space is somewhere else, tell us about it anyway and we will be straight with you about whether we can serve it properly yet rather than take the order and hope.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long is the commitment?',
    answer:
      'Rotation runs as a rolling subscription with a three-month minimum, which is one full cycle - long enough to actually see a refresh before you decide anything. After that, thirty days of notice ends it. The last set of photographs comes back to us, and the frames stay yours to fill with whatever you like.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does installation involve?',
    answer:
      'A short site survey comes first, because drywall, brick, glass partitions and exposed concrete each need a different anchor and we would rather know before we arrive with a drill. On the day: two people, drop cloths, a laser level and a vacuum. We drill, mount, level, wipe the glass down and take the packaging away with us. Three to twelve frames takes two to three hours. We work around your service hours - early mornings, Sundays, between lunch and dinner - at no extra charge.',

            doing it — four equal cells holding four equal paragraphs is that
            shape whatever you put inside them. Swapping a glyph for a hairline
            changed the decoration and left the form alone.

            As rows the prose also gets a measure it can be read at. Across four
            columns each body was set about 30 characters wide, which is a column
            for a caption, not for three sentences; and the second title —
            "Curation matched to your interiors" — wrapped to two lines while its
            neighbours stayed on one, so the four bodies all began at different
            heights and the row sat crooked.

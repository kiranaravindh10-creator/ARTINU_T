/*
  THE FOUR-ICON VALUES ROW IS GONE.

  It was a lucide glyph, a letterspaced label and a sentence, four across -
  "Seen in Real Spaces", "Fair & Transparent", "Growing Together", "Creative
  Freedom". That layout is the single most recognisable thing a generated
  marketing page produces, which is what the founder was reacting to.

  One of the four was also a promise ARTINU cannot keep yet: "You know what you
  earn on every frame, before it is printed", under a hand-holding-coins icon.
  Nobody is being paid per print today. That is the sentence a photographer
  screenshots and asks about, and it had to go regardless of how the row looked.

  What replaces it says the thing the founder actually wants said - that this is
  not a camera club - and it says it over real photographs by real members
  instead of four abstractions over stock. See ShotOnAnything below.

/**
 * Featured artists stay hidden until the roster is worth featuring.
 *
 * Picking eight "featured" photographers out of nine tells a visitor there are
 * nine. The founder's instruction was to hide the strip "until we reach like 20
 * to 30 photographers" - so it is a threshold rather than a switch someone has
 * to remember to flip, and the section reappears on its own the day the
 * directory passes it.
 *
 * Note it CANNOT be hidden by emptying the curated list in the console: the
 * server falls back to auto-featured artists when that list is empty
 * (server/src/routes/user.routes.ts), so the strip would silently repopulate.

/**
 * "It does not have to be a camera."
 *
 * The founder's point, in his words: "photography in art doesn't limit only
 * with respect to camera, even with respect to mobile people can shoot and they
 * can upload - that part we need to focus upon". Photographers were signing up
 * and then not uploading, and one reason a page can cause that is by looking
 * like it is addressed to someone with better equipment than you.
 *
 * So this says it plainly, and it says it over REAL WORK BY REAL MEMBERS. Every
 * other photograph on this page is Unsplash stock; a page about ARTINU's
 * photographers that contains none of their photographs is going to read as
 * generic no matter how the words are set.
 *
 * The covers come from the directory query that is already on the page, so this
 * costs no extra request. With fewer than three of them the strip is dropped and
 * the statement stands on its own rather than rendering a lopsided row.

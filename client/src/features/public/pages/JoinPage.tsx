  Four propositions, no glyphs.

  Each of these used to sit under a bronze disc holding a lucide icon — a globe
  for "Get Discovered", a trending-up arrow for "Grow Together". None of them
  told a photographer anything the heading beside it did not, and four identical
  discs in a row is the house style of every template that has ever shipped a
  feature grid. Hairlines separate them now, which is what the rest of the site
  already uses.

  These are not steps, so they are deliberately not numbered — unlike STEPS
  below, where the order is the whole point.

  Two of these implied paid work and neither should have.

  "Exclusive Opportunities - access curated projects, shooting opportunities, and
  partner collaborations" describes a jobs board. ARTINU is not commissioning
  shoots, and "opportunities" is the word a photographer reads as "gigs". It has
  been replaced with the thing ARTINU actually does, which is better anyway:
  your photograph gets printed and hung on a wall in a real room.

  "brands" came out of the first entry for the same reason - it reads as
  commercial clients.

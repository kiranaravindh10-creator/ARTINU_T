    ── Why these two cases now share a branch ──────────────────────────────────

    They used to be separate, and the loading case rendered a full-bleed dark
    panel with a pulsing gradient and no words. That is defensible when a
    request takes 200ms. It is not what actually happens here: the API runs on a
    host that sleeps when idle, so the first visitor after a quiet spell waits
    tens of seconds — and for all of it the largest element on the site was a
    black rectangle. That is the "this is really slow" screen.

    The editorial hero below needs nothing from the network. Its photograph is a
    local WebP that the browser has already been told to preload, so it paints
    on the first frame, says what ARTINU does and offers somewhere to go. If
    curated slides then arrive, the slideshow takes over.

    Showing real content immediately and upgrading it beats showing a void and
    waiting: the visitor can read, decide and click during the seconds the
    database is still thinking, and on a cold start those are the only seconds
    most of them will give us.

            ── THE PHOTOGRAPH IS NO LONGER CROPPED TO FIT THE FRAME ──────────

            This layer used to be one `object-cover` image with a Ken Burns
            scale on top of it, which cut the artwork twice over. A portrait
            photograph in a wide desktop hero lost its top and bottom; on a
            phone, where this frame is a tall 100dvh, a landscape photograph
            lost its sides. Whatever the photographer framed, the container
            decided what survived — and the 1.06 push-in then took a little
            more from every edge.

            It is now two layers of the SAME image:

              · an ambient field behind, cover-fitted and blurred far past
                legibility, so the frame is filled with light drawn from the
                photograph itself rather than a bar of black. It is scaled up
                because a blur samples past its own edges and would otherwise
                show a soft border.

              · the photograph in front, `object-contain`, complete. Every
                edge the photographer included is on screen, at any aspect
                ratio, on any viewport.

            When a photograph already matches the frame — a landscape shot on a
            desktop — contain and cover resolve to the same pixels and the
            ambient layer is completely hidden behind it. Nothing changes for
            those, which is most of them. It only does work where the old
            behaviour was destroying something.

            Both layers take the same `src`, so the browser selects one srcset
            candidate and downloads it once.

 * them in place — same frame, same size, no controls. `PARTNER_GALLERIES` below
 * is the map; it is a stopgap until the table can hold a gallery of its own.

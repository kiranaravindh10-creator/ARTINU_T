    They used to be separate, and the loading case rendered a full-bleed dark
    panel with a pulsing gradient and no words. That is defensible when a
    request takes 200ms. It is not what actually happens here: the API runs on a

    tens of seconds — and for all of it the largest element on the site was a
    black rectangle. That is the "this is really slow" screen.

    The editorial hero below needs nothing from the network. Its photograph is a
    local WebP that the browser has already been told to preload, so it paints
    on the first frame, says what ARTINU does and offers somewhere to go. If
    curated slides then arrive, the slideshow takes over.

    Showing real content immediately and upgrading it beats showing a void and
    waiting: the visitor can read, decide and click during the seconds the
    database is still thinking, and on a cold start those are the only seconds
    most of them will give us.

                A stack, the photograph, a stack — running across on a wide
                frame and down on a tall one.

                The feature's track is a measured pixel width, not `auto` with
                an aspect-ratio child. That version asks the browser to size a
                track from an item whose height depends on the track it is in,
                which is the circular case in grid sizing and resolves
                differently depending on the engine. The frame is already
                measured here, and the photograph's ratio with it, so the exact
                number is known: at the frame's full height the picture is
                `frame.h * ratio` wide, and that is the track. It fits to the
                pixel, top and bottom, with nothing cut.

                The two `1fr` tracks take everything left over, which is why no
                part of the frame is ever bare.

                The 2px gaps are the only non-photographic pixels on screen, and
                they read as the join between prints rather than as a colour.

/**
 * The gallery opening: the people behind the photographs, not a collage of
 * stock imagery.
 *
 * What it replaced was four fixed Unsplash pictures under `aria-hidden` beside
 * the words "Photography that speaks." Nothing in it came from ARTINU, and a
 * visitor could read the whole thing without learning that anyone in particular
 * had taken any of it.
 *
 * Everything here is the real roster, read from /users/artists — names, cities,
 * their own cover images and avatars, and their real published counts. It grows
 * on its own as photographers join, and it degrades to the text block alone if
 * the request fails.
 *
 * WHY AN ART WALL RATHER THAN A NETWORK DIAGRAM
 *
 * The tiles sit in a grid whose one-pixel gaps are the connective tissue: the
 * container is the line colour and the cells sit on top of it, so the hairlines
 * between creators are the grid itself. That reads as an editorial wall of work
 * — which is what ARTINU physically builds — where drawn connector lines would
 * have read as an org chart. It also means no absolute positioning, so nothing
 * can overflow and there is no layout shift as images arrive.
 */

/**
 * The composition. Each entry is one tile's span and what it shows.
 *
 * Deliberately irregular and deliberately fixed: a stable pattern means the wall
 * looks composed rather than randomly generated, and the same artist keeps the
 * same tile between renders. `cover` tiles are wide and carry the photographer's
 * own backdrop; `portrait` tiles are tall and lead with their face.

 * walking the row-major placement, not by eye. That matters because the grid
 * container is the line colour with one-pixel gaps: any cell the tiles fail to
 * cover is not empty space, it is a grey rectangle.
 *
 * An earlier pattern covered 14 of the 16 and would have shipped two of them.

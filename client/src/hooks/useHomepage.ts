/**
 * THE HOMEPAGE'S CONTENT, FETCHED ONCE AND REMEMBERED BETWEEN VISITS.
 *
 * ── What was wrong ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The homepage asked for its furniture in five separate requests and kept the
 * answers only in memory, with a five-minute `gcTime`. So every arrival — a new
 * visitor, a reload, a return an hour later — began with an empty page and five
 * round trips to an API in Singapore that runs on a free Render instance and
 * spins down when idle. Warm, that is about six seconds of sequential waiting
 * for four kilobytes. Cold, the first request alone was measured at 31.7
 * seconds.
 *
 * And the sections do not wait politely. Collaborations and testimonials both
 * `return null` when their data has not arrived, so a slow or failed fetch did
 * not show a spinner or a gap — the sections were simply NOT THERE, and then
 * were there on the next visit once the dyno had woken. That is the whole of
 * "sometimes it comes, sometimes it doesn't".
 *
 * ── What this does ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One request, and the last good answer kept in localStorage as `initialData`.
 * A returning visitor therefore paints the complete homepage — hero, cafés,
 * quotes — on the FIRST FRAME, from disk, with no network at all, while a
 * background refetch quietly brings it up to date. The API being asleep stops
 * being something the visitor experiences.
 *
 * The trade is deliberate and small: for up to a minute after a manager edits
 * the homepage, a returning visitor may see the previous version before the
 * refetch lands. Stale-for-a-moment beats absent, on the page that is the first
 * thing anyone sees.
 */

/**
 * One photograph in the hero carousel, already resolved by the API.
 *
 * The browser used to work this out for itself: it downloaded every slide just
 * to read `naturalWidth` and decide what shape it was. The server knows,
 * because `artworks` records the dimensions, so it decides and sends six
 * landscape photographs with their credits attached.

  SUPABASE STORAGE RESIZES ON REQUEST, AND UNTIL NOW NOTHING ASKED IT TO.

  Every photograph a member uploads lands in Supabase Storage and is served
  straight from `/storage/v1/object/public/…` — the original file, byte for
  byte. Measured on the live gallery: the first seven tiles alone are 17 MB, and
  a full page of twenty-four is roughly 62 MB, to draw images about 324px wide.
  That is the whole of "the gallery is slow", and it is a bytes problem, so no
  amount of lazy-loading or caching touches it.

  Swapping `/object/public/` for `/render/image/public/` and adding a width
  turns the same file into a resized one. Measured on a real 3.4 MB PNG upload:

      original            3,522,426 bytes
      render, width=800     339,270 bytes   (WebP)     ~10x smaller
      render, width=1600    403,398 bytes   (WebP)

  WebP is negotiated from the browser's Accept header, which every browser
  ARTINU supports sends, so no format parameter is needed.

  ── How this relates to the stored variants ────────────────────────────────

  `buildVariantSrcSet` (shared/src/media.ts) is still the better answer and
  still wins when an artwork has variants: those are generated once at upload
  and served as plain files. Supabase charges per transformation, so this path
  costs money per unique size served, where stored variants do not.

  This exists because it needs no migration and no backfill — it makes all 53
  photographs already in the database fast today, and it keeps working for any
  upload whose resize did not run.

  NOTE: image transformations are a paid Supabase feature. If the plan is
  downgraded these URLs stop resolving, which is why `looksLikeSupabaseStorage`
  is deliberately narrow and everything else falls through to the original.
*/
/*
  The parameter that keeps a photograph the shape it was taken.

  `?width=800` on its own does NOT scale the image — it sets the width and
  leaves the height at the original, which stretches the picture. Measured
  against the live files, every one of them:

      Thridham    1600x2762  ->  ?width=800                 800x2762   r 0.579 -> 0.290
      imlight_fr  2834x3777  ->  ?width=800                 800x3777   r 0.750 -> 0.212
      Jayashree   1600x1201  ->  ?width=800                 800x1201   r 1.332 -> 0.666

      Thridham    1600x2762  ->  ?width=800&resize=contain   800x1381   r 0.579 kept
      imlight_fr  2834x3777  ->  ?width=800&resize=contain   800x1066   r 0.750 kept
      Jayashree   1600x1201  ->  ?width=800&resize=contain   800x601    r 1.332 kept

  `contain` is the mode that means "fit inside, keep the ratio" — with only a
  width given it is simply a scale. Without it every artist's work on the site
  was being served squashed, and `object-fit: cover` cannot undo that: cover
  crops the file it is given, and the file itself was the wrong shape.

  This is why the hero looked soft as well as wrong. A 2834-wide picture
  squashed to 800x3777 and then stretched back across the screen is two lossy
  resamples of the same pixels.

 *
 * An upload is stored exactly as the photographer sent it, and `thumbnailUrl`
 * points at that same file. Photographers send full-resolution work: measured
 * against the live gallery, page one was 47.8 MB across 24 photographs, the
 * largest of them 9.6 MB — around a hundred seconds on a normal 4G phone, for
 * one screen of thumbnails. The images were never broken; they had not
 * finished arriving.
 *
 * Supabase Storage will resize on request. Swapping `/object/` for
 * `/render/image/` and asking for a width turns that 9.6 MB into roughly 90 KB,
 * and the browser's own `Accept: image/webp` gets WebP back without asking.
 * Nothing is re-uploaded and no stored URL changes — the original stays exactly
 * where it is, which matters because it is the artist's file.

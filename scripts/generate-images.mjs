 *
 * `buildHeroSrcSet`/`buildThumbnailSrcSet` in client/src/lib/imageOptimization
 * can only synthesise a srcSet for Unsplash and picsum URLs, because those
 * services resize on request. A local file gets no srcSet at all, so every
 * phone downloads the desktop image. Generating the widths ahead of time is
 * what lets a local photograph compete with a CDN one.
 *
 * Each entry also emits a 24px WebP as a base64 data URI, collected into
 * client/src/lib/generated-images.ts. That is what fills the frame on the
 * first paint instead of a grey box — inlined, so it costs no request.
 *
 * Crops are declared, never guessed. A 1600×1600 café photograph placed in a
 * 4:3 card has to lose 400px somewhere, and `position` says where from.

    The three Nib & Nosh photographs, all at 4:5.

    The collaboration card is portrait because the supplied card image is: it is
    1080×1350 with the ARTINU/Nib & Nosh lockup and the café's address across the
    bottom third. Cropping it to a landscape 4:3 cut exactly that off. The two
    interior shots are 4:5 and 1:1, so both survive this ratio with room to
    spare, and all three can sit in one frame without changing size as they
    rotate.

    The collaboration card is never wider than ~450 CSS px in its grid, so 1024
    covers it at 2× and there is no larger step to ship.

    THE TEAM PORTRAITS.

    Seven people, all at 4:5 to match the founder's frame on the About page, and
    all cropped `north` — these are phone photographs of people, and centre-
    cropping a standing figure to a portrait card takes the head off. One is a
    landscape 16:9 selfie and one a 3024×4032 iPhone HEIC; north survives both.

    The HEIC was decoded with `heic-convert` before it landed in
    assets/source/team, because sharp's bundled libheif has no HEVC decoder —
    the same reason server/src/services/image-variants.service.ts keeps that
    fallback for uploads. The master committed here is the converted JPEG.

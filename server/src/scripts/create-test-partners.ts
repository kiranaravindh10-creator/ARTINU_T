 *
 * ── Why the passwords come from the environment ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * They are not in this file and must not be. `create-staff.ts` hardcodes its
 * demo passwords and says so plainly - they are published in the repository,
 * and anyone who reads it can sign in. These three are credentials somebody
 * actually typed at us, so they are read from the environment, used once to
 * hash, and never written anywhere. The database only ever sees the bcrypt
 * hash, via the same `setPassword` the real sign-up uses.
 *
 * ── Why it refuses production ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * These are demonstration partners with invented addresses. Creating them in a
 * live database would put fictional businesses in the Console next to real
 * ones, where the next person cannot tell which is which.
 *
 * Safe to re-run: an account that already exists is reported and skipped, never
 * modified, so this can never reset a password somebody has chosen.
 *
 * `--cleanup` removes exactly what this script creates - the three users, their
 * profiles, and their spaces - matched by their marker email domain, and
 * nothing else. It refuses to touch a space it did not create.

/**
 * THE WHOLE HOMEPAGE, IN ONE REQUEST.
 *
 * ── The problem this exists to solve ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Opening artinu.in fired FIVE separate calls for homepage furniture — the hero
 * slides, the slideshow settings, the collaborations, the featured collections
 * and the testimonials. Measured against the live API in Singapore, each one
 * costs about 1 to 1.5 seconds of round trip, and together they carry a little
 * over four kilobytes. Four kilobytes should not cost six seconds.
 *
 * Worse is what happened when the API was asleep. It runs on a free Render
 * instance that spins down after inactivity, and a cold start was measured at
 * 31.7 seconds against 1.1 warm. Every one of those five calls was a separate
 * chance to be the one still in flight when the visitor gave up or scrolled —
 * and the sections are written to render NOTHING rather than a broken frame
 * when their data has not arrived. So the collaborations and the testimonials
 * did not appear "slowly". They were simply absent, and then present on the
 * next visit once somebody's first request had woken the dyno. That is exactly
 * the "sometimes it comes, sometimes it doesn't" this endpoint answers.
 *
 * One request means one cold start to wait through instead of five, one cache
 * entry to warm, and — with the client storing the payload — one thing to paint
 * instantly on the next visit.
 *
 * ── What it does NOT do ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does not replace the five endpoints it aggregates. The Console's content
 * manager still reads and writes through those, and they are unchanged. This is
 * a read-only view assembled for one screen, added beside them.
 *
 * The gallery calls are deliberately left out. They are an order of magnitude
 * larger (24 KB for eight photographs against 4 KB for all of this), they are
 * already paginated and cached on their own terms, and folding them in would
 * make the one thing the homepage blocks on five times heavier.

    without a round trip is most of the win. `cachePublic` downgrades itself to
    `private, no-store` if the request carries credentials, so a signed-in

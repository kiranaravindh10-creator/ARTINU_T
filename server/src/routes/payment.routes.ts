/**
 * Razorpay webhook.
 *
 * Mounted above `requireAuth` on purpose: the caller is Razorpay, which has no
 * ARTINU session. Its authentication is the HMAC over the raw body, checked
 * before anything else happens.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE /:id/verify
 *
 * The browser callback is the fast path and the happy path, and it is not
 * reliable: the customer can close the tab, lose signal, or have the redirect
 * eaten between paying and telling us. The money still moved. The webhook is the
 * path that does not depend on the customer's browser surviving, and it is what
 * makes "paid but the order never confirmed" a state that heals itself.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction: a payment already `succeeded` returns 200 without
 * re-issuing an invoice or a second payout, and Razorpay retries until it gets a
 * 2xx, so anything other than success must NOT return 200.
